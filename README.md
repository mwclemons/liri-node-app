# liri-node-app

**Assignment** 
Make a command line node app that takes in parameters and based on the paramenters returns specific data from APIs.  
There were 4 possible commands:
1. node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>
    - This command returns the full list of concert dates and venues for the artist/band given in the command line.  This command uses the the Bands in Town Artist Events API.
2. node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'
    - This command returns the artist, song name, preview link and album of the song given in the command line.  This command uses the Spotify API.
3. node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>' 
    - This command returns the movie title, year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country, language, plot and actors of the movie given in the command line.  This command uses the OMDB API. 
4. node liri.js do-what-it-says
    - This command will run one of the above 3 commands depending on what is in the random.txt file.  
**Bonus** - have the application write the results of the command line inputs to the terminal and to a file called log.txt.
